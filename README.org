#+TITLE: OrgMark

With OrgMark, you can use iPad to draw figures and insert them into Org files. You can also edit these figures later.

* Install
1. Open the workspace with Xcode, you will see two projects, Build Org Mark for iPad and orgmark for Mac. 
2. Put the orgmark executable under PATH. 
3. Install the Org Mark app to your iPad (by whatever means).
4. Put orgmark.el under your ~load-path~ and require it.

* Usage
From Org mode: =M-x orgmark-insert=, or =M-x orgmark-edit=.

Alternately, you can use orgmark from command line. The extension has to be “pkdrawing”.
#+begin_example
$ orgmark --help

  -h, --height <height>   Max height of the exported image in pixels.
  -n, --new               Create new drawing.
  -h, --help              Show help information.
#+end_example

* Known problems

- Only support pkdrawing files (which is an extension I made up for storing Apple’s PencilKit binary drawing data).
- Crashes and hangs, this is really just a quick hack on top of existing solutions (PencilKit).
- Only works on WiFi. I tried with BLE, but the bandwidth is too low for the data we are transferring.
